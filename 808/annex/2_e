E is the evaluator, we meet them in the beginning 

there's darkness. the easy type. the passive type. someone else then her turned off the lights. the smells of the room live in their nose, it smells like dust and dog and dog butt, and her breath, her skin, her hair. her hair is all over, around her face poking out of her head and spilling on her back. she can feel it touching her skin, the little hairs on her skin. her skin, dry on the legs and on the face, mushy, sweaty, sticky. her arms are stuck on her side. the thought of moving them scares her, what if the skin tears off, what if she's been there for so long she's just a sleeve of skin. what if she opens her eyes and she's just a mass of flesh  and skin, she can feel herself breathing, her ribcage giving her shape. her tongue is pushing on her teeth, they feel like prolapsed bone, her tongue feels to big to be her own, she feel like she needs to spit it out, it's choking her. She finally opens her eyes and the room is so small, is she in a grave? a well lit grave? it feels like a grave, it feels like she needs to breath less or the air will run out. and then she bats her eyelids and the light goes off briefly and on again. like a punch in the face. Andy barges in the room: have you seen my green tshirt? 
Did she fall asleep? it felt like.. not existing.
